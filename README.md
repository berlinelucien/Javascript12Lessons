Have you always wanted to learn the JavaScript language but didn’t know where to start? JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and there is a worldwide shortage of good programmers. JavaScript programmers in the US typically enjoy a six figure salary. In this course I teach JavaScript from the foundations, taking a modern approach to the language including modules and classes. Don’t worry if you haven’t the faintest idea what a module or a class is, that’s what the course is for! Because all browsers use JavaScript you already have the necessary tools to get started. After the first 3 lessons I'll show you how to install and setup the free code editor VSCode to continue with the course. You'll even get a free e-book that will help you as you complete the course.

I’m Nik Lever and I’ve been developing web apps for over 25 years. I know that trying to get started with programming can feel a little bit daunting - and so I am here to make that process easier for you. I've taught over 20,000 students.

Try and complete one lesson a day and you will have the basic building blocks necessary to make many web applications. In just two weeks you will have taken the first steps to entering the industry and enjoying a rewarding and fulfilling career.
